			<p>In the span of nine months, Staten Island has gone from the borough with the <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/529477-cuomo-says-staten-island-accounts-for-a-fourth-of-all-nyc-virus-deaths">lowest cases of COVID-19 to the highest.</a>  Staten Island has only <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/529477-cuomo-says-staten-island-accounts-for-a-fourth-of-all-nyc-virus-deaths">5% of the population but a death rate 40% higher than any other borough.</a> 
			<br>
			<br>
			Lower population density might play a role.  According to a study by <a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2020/urban-density-not-linked-to-higher-coronavirus-infection-rates-and-is-linked-to-lower-covid-19-death-rates.html">John Hopkins University</a>, suburban sprawl, not urban density leads to higher levels of COVID-19 infections and death.
			<br>
			<br>"People in dense places are more likely to take 'stay at home' orders seriously or are more likely to wear masks just because they are more aware of the threat,"<a href="https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/2020/08/11/suburbs-not-cities-worse-covid-19-transmission/3337128001/">said Reid Ewing, co-author of the study</a>.
			<br>
			<br>
			Public outrage about COVID-19 restrictions might also be a factor.  Parents have threatened to <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/01/staten-island-parents-demand-schools-reopen-threaten-suit/">sue to open schools</a>, bar owners<a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2020/11/26/staten-island-restaurant-autonomous-zone-coronavirus-restrictions-covid-19/"> have openly flouted the law</a>, and <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/coronavirus/2020/5/20/21270841/staten-island-gop-politicians-rally-around-reopening-nyc">public officials have organized anti-COVID-19 restriction rallies</a> as far back as May 20th.</p>
